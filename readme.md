# Backend Repository

Welcome to my backend repository where I store all my backend and database-related tasks. In this repository, I implement various backend technologies and frameworks to build different applications.

## Current Project: CRUD Auth Vote System

### Description:
The current project in this repository is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with authentication and voting functionality. It's built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. Users can authenticate, create, read, update, and delete items, as well as vote on certain items.

### Technologies Used:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Other relevant technologies (e.g., JWT for authentication)

### Project Structure:
- Currently one project only. (Will add soon)


### Usage:
This repo offers PostgreSQL database setup with ORM and backend system for user authentication, CRUD with posts, and upvote/downvote functionality.
1. Setup PostgreSQL database and integrate ORM.
2. Migrate schema for users and posts.
3. Implement user authentication securely.
4. Enable CRUD operations for posts.
5. Implement upvote/downvote logic.
6. Run backend locally or deploy.
7. Test functionality using Postman.
8. Monitor and maintain deployed system. 


## Future Plans:
In the future, I plan to expand this repository by adding more projects and incorporating additional backend technologies. Some of the technologies and frameworks I plan to work with include:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- GraphQL
- etc.
